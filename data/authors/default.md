## Current situation

I'm in second grade of a three years game development degree at E-artsup Nantes, France.

## How did I discover my appeal for code

I originally joined my school with little to no understanding of what it's like to code. I was more interested by the design side of game creation. I saw the coding part as an interesting new skill to learn, but I never imagined that it would become my favorite part ! Now I like to code more than anything else in the game creation process.

## Ask me anything

If you're new to this world and struggling with anything, feel free to contact me, I'll do my best to help !

### Special thanks

I would like to start by thanking my friend Hugo Blanchard, who often helped me when I was struggling with my code, and helped me building this website.
