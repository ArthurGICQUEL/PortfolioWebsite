## The game

Po. is a shoot 'em up where each boss gameplay is inspired by other games I like. The two bosses currently present in the game are respectivly inspired by Audiosurf and Super Hexagon. In between the bossfights, I tried to make the game fun by making the ennemies drop a lot of shooting upgrades, so the player has a lot of chance to become OP.

## The context of creation

I created Po. during my first week at E-artsup and it was also my first time making a video game. It was during this project that I discovered my interest for coding, seeing all the possibilities and the satisfaction to see something I coded myself work as I intended.
