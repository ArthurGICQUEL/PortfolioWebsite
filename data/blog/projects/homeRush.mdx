## The game

HomeRush is a local versus game, in which you have to be the first to find a defined object and bring it to the center of the map. You can dash into the other player to steal the object he's carrying. You can also dash to dodge the other player if you're the one carrying the object.

## The context of creation

This game was made during the Glabal Game Jam of 2020 (theme : "Lost and found") by a team of one developer and four artists. It was a first game jam for every member of the team, so we tried to keep the project as simple as possible but still fun to play in the end. It's one of my best developing memories, the really short deadline (48h) and the emulation created by the jam atmosphere really made it an exciting project. And succesfully deliver a game that we were all proud of was a real accomplishment !
