## The game

Ashkyn is a third person platforming / infiltration game project in wich you play as Kyn a spirit in a dying forest. You'll need to dodge other animal spirits to get to the heart of the forest and try to save it. We tried to make the game fun to play and to speedrun by giving the player the time he took to finish each level, as well as telling him if he was spotted and found all the hidden objects.

## The context of creation

We created this game as a team of two devs and 4 artists as our end of first year project. It was my first time working on a 3D game, and my first two months project. We encountered several difficulties, a good part coming from the fact that we chose to use unity HDRP as complete beginners. But even if our original idea did not translate as much as we would have liked in the final version, this project really helped us to surpass ourselves and progress in many areas like long-term organisation, keeping a readable and usable code base in the long run and more accurately evaluate the time it takes to learn new skills.
