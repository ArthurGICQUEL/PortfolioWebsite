## The game

In SheepDog you play as a border collie in charge of a group of sheeps. You have to bark to lead the herd to an encloture while dodging wolves and cliffs.

## The context of creation

This game was made during a five days school project in a "game jam format". Our team was composed of one developer and 2 artists. It was my first time working with game artists, and still one of my first experiences making games. It's also one of the projects that allow me to understand the satisfaction of coding a game by my own hands and gave me my appeal for code.
